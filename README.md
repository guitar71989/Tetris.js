CSS3.

## Screenshots

Upon loading the game, a modal appears with a "Play" button and the basic
game instructions. For the sake of clean code, I created all of the modal-
related html as variables using jQuery, along with a modal function to
call them. Within jQuery's version the DOMContentLoaded event listener,
I opened the modal.
